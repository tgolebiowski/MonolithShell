# MonolithShell
A Monolithic Graphical User Shell

Intended to be a shell that takes care of most of my non-other-software needs, including Task Switching, Process Viewing/Killing, and File Management.  One piece of software whose work load spilt between like 3 different processes (on Windows at least).
